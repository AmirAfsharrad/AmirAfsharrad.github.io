I'm planning to add some notes here to explain some of my more interesting research projects. In the meantime, I'm just putting a number of selected publications here, categorized under some of my broader research categories. For a full list of my publications, see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuvhn2oAAAAJ&hl=en).
