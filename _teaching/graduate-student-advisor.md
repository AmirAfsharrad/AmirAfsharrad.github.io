I have been serving as the Graduate Student Advisor (a.k.a. the Grad TA) since 2024, where I am a point of contact between the department and the graduate student body of the EE department. I support grad students with a variety of matters ranging from student life, MS or PhD program requirements, MS proposal, finding TA/RA positions, finding research advisors, the PhD rotation program, and more. As the Grad TA, I also serve as a student member of the Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) at the EE Department.

I regularly host walk-in office hours, and office hours can also be booked via Calendly.
