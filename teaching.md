## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Rigorous foundations**: Building deep understanding of fundamental concepts
- **Practical applications**: Connecting theory to real-world problems
- **Active learning**: Encouraging students to solve problems independently
- **Accessibility**: Making complex topics approachable through clear explanations
