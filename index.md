## Research Expecrience
* I am currently a working on a project about Edge Machine Learning, aiming to produce efficient algorithms for deep learning on limited-resource edge devices. This research is conducted under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFIJZwoAAAAJ&hl=en">Mohammadali Maddah-Ali</a>.

* I am also currently a member of Signal Processing Reseach Lab at Sharif University of Technology, where I work on statistical signal processing and separation of
nonlinear mixtures of stochastic processes under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://sharif.edu/~mbzadeh/">Massoud Babaie-Zadeh</a>.
  
* I am also a member of Theoretical Machine Learning Reading Group, where various papers on machine learning are explored. This group is also supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFIJZwoAAAAJ&hl=en">Mohammadali Maddah-Ali</a>.

* From 2017 unitl 2019 I was a member of the Augmented Intelligence Research Lab (AIRLab) at Sharif University of Technology, where I worked on different projects on computational neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bLuKrjgAAAAJ&hl=en">Hamid K. Aghajan</a>. In AIRLab, I participated in multiple projects, including an extensive project on processing brain signals in olfactory tasks and a project on decoding surprise in oddball tasks.
