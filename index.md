## About

I am a PhD candidate in [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by [Professor Sanjay Lall](https://lall.stanford.edu/).

My current research primarily focuses on **post-training of large language models**, **LLM alignment with human preferences**, and **evaluation and reward modeling of LLMs**.

I am also interested in more theoretical problems in **optimization and reinforcement learning**, including bandit problems with safety constraints and multi-agent settings, as well as problems at the intersection of **optimization and control** such as applications of transformer models in control theory and autonomous systems. These areas were a primary focus earlier in my PhD, and I continue to work on projects in these directions.

Prior to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.sharif.ir/home), where I was advised by [Prof. Mohammadali Maddah-Ali](https://maddah.umn.edu/).
