## Research Expecrience
* I am currently a working on a project about Edge Machine Learning, aiming to produce efficient algorithms for deep learning on limited-resource edge devices. This research is conducted under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFIJZwoAAAAJ&hl=en">Mohammadali Maddah-Ali</a>.

* I am also currently a member of Signal Processing Reseach Lab at Sharif University of Technology, where I work on statistical signal processing and separation of
nonlinear mixtures of stochastic processes under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://sharif.edu/~mbzadeh/">Massoud Babaie-Zadeh</a>.
  
* I am also a member of Theoretical Machine Learning Reading Group, where various papers on machine learning are explored. This group is also supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFIJZwoAAAAJ&hl=en">Mohammadali Maddah-Ali</a>.

* From 2017 unitl 2019 I was a member of the Augmented Intelligence Research Lab (AIRLab) at Sharif University of Technology, where I worked on different projects on computational neuroscience under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bLuKrjgAAAAJ&hl=en">Hamid K. Aghajan</a>. In AIRLab, I participated in multiple projects, including an extensive project on processing brain signals in olfactory tasks and a project on decoding surprise in oddball tasks.

## Teaching Experience
During my undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology, I have been a teaching assistant for many courses, including a graduate course of Computation Neuroscience (4 times), Convex Optimization, Probability and Statistics, Communication Systems, Signals and Systems (2 times), and Engineering Mathematics (3 times). This has been a huge experience of teaching, where I have held tutorial classes on deep learning, probability theory, convex optimization, signal processing and Fourier & complex analysis.

I have also been a teacher to highschool students in mathematics and physics in different instituitions such as <a href="https://amoozz.ir/">Zehn-e-Ziba Institute</a> and <a href="https://alavi.ir/"> Alavi Educational Institute </a> both as a job and for charity.
