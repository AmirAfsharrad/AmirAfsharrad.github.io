Welcome to my newly redesigned website!

After several years, I've finally updated my personal page to better reflect my current work and interests. This site now includes:

- Information about my research in optimization and machine learning
- A list of my publications and ongoing projects
- Details about my teaching experience
- A blog for sharing ideas and technical notes

I'm excited to use this space to share updates about my research and occasionally write about topics I find interesting. Stay tuned for more posts!

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:afsharrad@stanford.edu).
